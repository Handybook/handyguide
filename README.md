# Handy Design System

## Mission

The design system was created to establish and ensure visual consistency. These guidelines allow teams build and iterate product faster. With less design decisions to make, teams can spend more time with design exploration and problem solving, which leads to better products and experiences for our pros and customers. 

### Consistency 

Set our users up for success by creating a consistent visual language that unifies the user experience across all of Handy's products. 

### Streamlined Processes 

Common languages across internal teams lead to faster and streamlined building processes \(without sacrificing design, consistency, and user experience\) 

### Documentation

Empower internal teams by creating a common language via good documentation. 

### Expand

In order to keep things fresh and updated, the output of this exercise must always be expanding and growing.

## Design System Status

As of February 2019:  
• Customer app resources \(Master Symbols File and documentation\) are done.

End of Q2 2019:
