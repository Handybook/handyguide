# Handy Style Guide

## Mission

The style guide was created to establish and ensure visual consistency. These guidelines allow teams build and iterate product faster. With less design decisions to make, teams can spend more time with design exploration and problem solving, which leads to better products and experiences for our pros and customers. 

### Consistency 

Set our users up for success by creating a consistent visual language that unifies the user experience across all of Handy's products. 

### Streamlined Processes 

Common languages across internal teams lead to faster and streamlined building processes \(without sacrificing design, consistency, and user experience\) 

### Documentation

Empower internal teams by creating a common design language via good documentation. 

### Expand

In order to keep things fresh and updated, the output of this exercise must always be expanding and growing.
