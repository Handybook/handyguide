## Avatars

Avatars are used to quickly identify users.

1. Body: The image that represents the user. When pros haven't uploaded an image, a default image will be displayed.

```text
max-width: 64px;
max-height: 64px;
```

2. Status: When a pro is favorited, the status will be represented by a heart. 

```text
max-width: 14px;
max-height: 14px;
```

### Styles of Avatars

Standard Avatars: When a larger avatar is needed like My Pros or Pro Search flows use a 64px avatar.

Small Avatars: When a smaller avatar is needed in small areas like a message thread use a 32px avatar.

Default Avatars: Use when the pro has not uploaded a photo. Rules of standard and small avatars apply to default avatars.
