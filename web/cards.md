# Cards

## **Card Usage**

### Service Cards

Service Cards are used to display service offerings, like Home Cleaning, and will direct the user to a more detailed page about the service when clicked on. They can be displayed in multiple layouts depending on the service offering and page view.

### Form Cards

Form cards are used to display form content, like payment details; however, this is only true for desktop. On mobile web, card ui hides and form content remains.

Refer to [Forms](https://app.gitbook.com/@handyguide/s/docs/web/forms) for more information. 

## Card Layouts

### Content Cards

Service Cards can be displayed in multiple formats: 3 column, 4 column, or 6 column. Card widths always align with the [grid](https://app.gitbook.com/@handyguide/s/docs/web/grid-and-layout) with 32px gutter between each one, while card heights are flexible and fit to the content.
