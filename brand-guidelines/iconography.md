These icons follow a formula and use a primary and secondary color. Shades of the primary color are used for stroke and fill while secondary colors are used for minor details like a smaller fill area or texture.

**Sizes:**

```text
background: light-handy-blue
max-width: 48px (home page)
max-width: 64px (avatar)
```

**Primary Colors:** Strokes use the medium-dark shade of the primary color. Fills use the medium-light shade of a primary color.

**Secondary Colors:** Strokes: medium-dark shade of secondary color. Fill: medium-light shade of secondary color. If multiple fill areas, textures, or strokes are needed, the light shade of the secondary color can also to be used.

Secondary color use is at the discretion of the creator but it must be a small part of the icon.
